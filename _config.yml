description: This machine learning project aims to build a model that can accurately classify websites as phishing or legitimate in order to protect users from fraudulent attacks. The dataset contains 30 website features for 11,000+ sites labeled as phishing or not. Logistic regression with L2 regularization and C=100 will be applied after splitting the data 70-30 into train and test sets. The model will be evaluated on its ability to correctly classify phishing and legitimate sites based on patterns learned from the training data features like URLs, domain details, and page content. Additional experiments will determine the most influential features. Overall, the key goal is developing an effective phishing website detector using logistic regression that can generalize well to new data and identify fraudulent sites.
